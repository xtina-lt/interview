                Introduction
            </h3>
            An interview with Melissa Longenberger was conducted on October 3, 2022, via zoom. Questions were asked about her current position, and what it takes to get to that level in software engineering. She talked about the things she loves about technology. She even gave insightful tips for future developers. Her insight and motivation spark creativity for herself and everyone surrounding her.

            <h3>
                Where She’s At
            </h3>
            Melissa Longenberger is not just an instructor at Coding Dojo, but a true engineer of creativity. You can go as far as calling her the captain of creativity. She helps groups of adults navigate the treacherous journey of learning software engineering in a small amount of time. The cohort she is currently teaching is projects and algorithms. Projects and algorithms class is part of an engineering boot camp where students create projects on their own and practice complex algorithms. She not only teaches these classes but helps students with their personal projects in many different languages. Her job is not an easy one, but Melissa certainly knows how to bring some fun and adventure into it.
            The tale of Melissa’s journey in software engineering is an enriching and fun one, to say the least. She started out her journey at a software engineering school herself. There she learned Django, JavaScript for server creation, HTML, CSS, and so much more. She used those skills to become a teaching assistant while finishing her program! That takes extreme work and dedication because these boot camps are quite intense. She was able to obtain a teaching position at a rival boot camp (Coding Dojo), and many current students are extremely grateful for it. Melissa’s journey made her who she is today, but her determination and work-ethic are what got her to her current position.

            <h3>
                What She Likes
            </h3>
                Melisa knew she enjoyed technology since she was a little girl. She described a day that her father took her to work. This was at a power plant, for a take your child to work day. She immediately took to the machines. That may have been the spark that she would eventually, not just become a software engineer, but teach others how to navigate their love for technology as well. Every coder remembers when that light turned on for themselves, but Mellissa just kept that light bright!
                The light of creativity is what keeps her going on her developer journey. Right now, she is working on an application to help people’s mental well-being. One can track their moods that correlate with symptoms, medication taken, and sugars. Melissa says the hardest thing about coding is the non-visual aspect of languages. This is the logic part of coding where you don’t if it is wrong until you try it, and it doesn’t work. She combats that by increasing printing statements to know which part is doing what. It is so touching when she says her favorite part of coding is creating something out of nothing. 

            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
                Creating something out of nothing is not only what she has done for her career, but has been exceptional at teaching others how to do that same exact thing within themselves. When asked about where to find female mentorship she says there really isn’t much of us in technology. In my opinion, she is mentoring women on creating something out of nothing every time she does a lecture. Her journey was one of authenticity just tapping into her natural creativity and curiosity about technology. Melissa Longenberger is an amazing woman for new developers to keep creating something out of nothing.
